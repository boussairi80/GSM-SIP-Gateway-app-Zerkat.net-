🚀 Requirement : 
Root access is required
Samsung Android devices only
support Any Android version 


By converting standard GSM gateway hardware functionality into an Android application, any supported Android device can act as a full SIP ↔ GSM bridge, enabling two-way call routing between SIM cards and SIP accounts—without dedicated GSM gateway hardware.

This approach dramatically simplifies deployment, reduces costs, and unlocks new mobile and remote use cases.

Key Features

📱 Android-powered GSM Gateway

Seamless routing between GSM (SIM) calls and SIP accounts (inbound & outbound)

🧩 No Dedicated Hardware Required
No GSM gateway boxes, antennas, wiring, or proprietary hardware

🚀 Portable & Flexible
Ideal for mobile deployments, remote locations, temporary installations, and backup routing

💰 Cost-Effective
Significantly reduces hardware, installation, and maintenance costs

📈 Simple Scalability
Scale horizontally by adding more Android devices as needed


🚀 Requirement : 
Root access is required
Samsung Android devices only
support Any Android version 


Additional Notes

This project is not intended for Google Play Store distribution


APK Distribution & Trial Policy

This repository includes a prebuilt APK for evaluation purposes.

Due to the nature of telecom systems and SIM-based routing, the application uses a device-binding security mechanism.

Device Binding

Each installation is bound to a specific device

A device must be explicitly authorized by our server before it becomes operational

Unauthorized devices will not be able to place or receive calls

This approach prevents abuse and ensures controlled, legitimate usage.

Free Trial

7-day free trial is available upon request

Trial period starts after device authorization

During the trial, all core GSM ↔ SIP features are enabled

After the trial period:

Continued usage requires approval or a commercial agreement

How to Request Access

Install the provided APK

Launch the application

Submit your device ID through the provided interface

Wait for authorization from our server

Once approved, the trial period begins automatically

Important Notes

Root access is still mandatory

Device authorization is manual

This project is not fully open-source

The APK is provided for evaluation and testing purposes only

Licensing & Usage

The source code in this repository is provided for reference and documentation

The APK remains proprietary

Redistribution of the APK is not permitted without written permission
